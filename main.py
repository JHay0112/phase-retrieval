    Phase Retrieval from Fourier Modulus of Image

    This is used to determine what an object looks like from the measurement of
    diffraction of a planar wave around the object. This shows up in experiments
    where X-rays are diffracted around crystals of interest and the diffracted rays
    measured with CCDs. The measured diffraction corresponds to the Fourier Modulus
    of the object.

    Based on the following

    Thank you Joe for teaching me about this :D
